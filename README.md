Matrices are undoubtedly a very important topic in many aspects such as math, computer science, 
engineering and so on. With the help of matrices many computational problems, ranging from finding 
roots of algebraic equations to extensive image manipulation and feature extraction in image processing 
and even video games, will become solvable. 

Due to the complexity of matrices calculation could be, we might need to utilize some tools and programs 
to help us to get the job done. The tools are meant here is an executable code that can perform some matrices 
calculations like multiplication and transposition of MxN matrices. The client or the user uses our code to perform 
complex operations of matrices calculations in a few minutes, hence the efficiency of calculation is increased while 
effort and time are decreased. 

This document discusses the implementation of matrices multiplication and transposition code. 
The matrix code was created in the C++ programming language. In this document, 
we will discuss some of the C++ powerful tools used in this matrix code such as 
the OOP “Object Oriented Programing” approach, classes, generic functions, and classes.
